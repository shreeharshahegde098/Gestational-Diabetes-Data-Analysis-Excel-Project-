🧮 Gestational Diabetes Data Analysis (Excel Project)
📌 Project Overview

This project involves analyzing a healthcare dataset related to Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) using Microsoft Excel.
The raw data was obtained from Kaggle (CSV format) and transformed into a structured Excel Table for easier analysis.

📊 Dataset Details

The dataset (Gest1.xlsx) contains patient health attributes such as:

Age

No of Pregnancy

Gestation in Previous Pregnancy

BMI

HDL

Family History

PCOS

Systolic BP (Sys_BP)

Diastolic BP (Dia_BP)

Hemoglobin

Sedentary Lifestyle

Prediabetes

Class Label (GDM / Non GDM) → Target Variable

Derived Features → Age_Basis, OGTT_Round

🛠 Operations Performed
🔹 1. Data Preparation

Imported raw Kaggle CSV data into Excel

Converted dataset into a Table format for structured analysis

Rounded OGTT values to 2 decimal places using =ROUND(cell,2)

Added a new feature Age_Basis using =IF(Age>21,"Adult","Child")

🔹 2. Conditional Formatting

Highlighted Hemoglobin < 13 in red color

Applied color scaling to:

Diastolic BP

Gestation in Previous Pregnancy

🔹 3. Descriptive Statistics

Using Data Analysis ToolPak, calculated for Price & Quantity (example) and applied same for health data:

Mean, Median, Mode

Standard Deviation & Variance

Range, Min/Max, Count

🔹 4. Pivot Tables & Slicers

Created Pivot Tables to summarize pregnancies vs age, GDM vs Non-GDM groups

Inserted Slicers to filter data interactively

📈 Key Insights

Age classification into Child vs Adult based on >21 rule

Hemoglobin deficiencies (<13) highlighted clearly

Conditional formatting helped visualize blood pressure & pregnancy history trends

Pivot + Slicer enabled dynamic exploration of GDM cases

📂 Files

Gest1.xlsx → Processed dataset with cleaning, derived features, formatting, pivots & slicers

🚀 Next Steps

Extend to Power BI dashboards for richer visualizations

Perform predictive analysis in Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn)

Explore deeper statistical comparisons between GDM vs Non-GDM

✅ This project highlights Excel-based data preparation, descriptive statistics, conditional formatting, and interactive analysis with Pivot + Slicer, forming a solid base before moving into Power BI and Python analytics.
